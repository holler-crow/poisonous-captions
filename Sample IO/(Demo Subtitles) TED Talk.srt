1
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,880
So in college.

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,280
I was a government major which means
I had to write a lot of papers.

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,960
Now when a normal student writes a paper

4
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,600
they might spread the work
out a little like this.

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,360
So you know.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,920
You get started maybe a little slowly
but you get enough done in the first week

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,160
that some have your days later on
everything gets done things stay civil

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and I would want to do that like that.

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,240
That would be the plan.

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,920
I would I would have it all ready to go.

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,880
But then than that the people would come
along and then I would kind of do this.

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,480
And that would happen every single paper.

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,760
But then came my 90 page senior thesis
paper you're supposed to spend a year on.

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,520
I knew for a paper like that my normal
workflow was not an option.

15
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,760
It was way too big a project.

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,560
So I planned things out and I decided
I kind of had to go something like this.

17
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,880
This is how the year would go.

18
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,160
So it started off light.

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,480
And I bumped it up in the middle months.

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,680
And then at the end I would kick it up
into high gears a little staircase.

21
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,160
How hard could it be
just walk up the stairs.

22
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,080
No big deal right.

23
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,480
But then funniest thing happened those
first few months they came and went.

24
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,440
And I I couldn't quite do stuff.

25
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,560
So we had an awesome new revised plan.

26
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,240
And then.

27
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,440
But then those middle months
actually went by.

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,680
And I didn't really write words.

29
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,400
And so we were here.

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,000
And then two months turned into one month

31
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,640
turned into two weeks
and one day I woke up.

32
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,240
With three days until the deadline.

33
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,360
Still not having written a word.

34
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,400
And so I did the only thing I could.

35
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,280
I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours
pulling not one but two all nighters.

36
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,240
Humans are not supposed
to put two all nighters.

37
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,760
Sprinted across campus dove in slow
motion and got it in of the deadline.

38
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,480
Now I thought that was
the end of everything.

39
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,520
But a week later I get a call.

40
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,560
It's the school.

41
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,320
And they say is this Tim Urban.

42
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,760
And I say Yeah.

43
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,960
And they say we need
to talk about your thesis.

44
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,160
And I say Okay.

45
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,600
And they say it's the best
one we've ever seen.

46
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,080
That did not happen.

47
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,680
It was a very very bad.

48
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,360
I just.

49
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,200
Wanted to enjoy that one moment when
all of you thought this guy's amazing.

50
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,160
No no.
It was very very bad.

51
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,680
Anyway today I'm a writer blogger guy.

52
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,360
I write the blog Wait But Why.

53
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,840
And a couple of years ago I decided
to write about Krastev nation my behaviors

54
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,080
are always perplexed the non
procrastinators around me and I wanted

55
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,240
to explain to the non
procrastinators of the world.

56
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,320
What goes on in the heads

57
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,360
of procrastinators and why
we are the where we are now.

58
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,000
I had a hypothesis that the brains

59
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,560
of procrastinators were actually different
than the brains of other people

60
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,280
and to testis I found an MRI lab
that she'd let me scan both my brain

61
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,160
and the brain of a proven non
procrastinator and I so I could compare

62
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,600
them and I actually brought
them here to show you today.

63
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,000
And I want you to take a look carefully

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,680
to see if you can notice the difference
and I know that if you're not a trained

65
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,480
brain expert it's not that obvious
but just take a look.

66
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,960
OK so here's the brain
of a non procrastinator.

67
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,680
Now.

68
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,560
Here's my brain.

69
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,800
There is a difference.

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,120
Both brains have a rational decision maker

71
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,920
in them but the procrastinators brain
also has an Instant Gratification Monkey.

72
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,640
Now what does this mean
for the procrastinator.

73
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,360
Well it means everything's
fine until this happens.

74
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,560
So the rational decision maker will make
the rational decision to do something

75
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,200
productive with the monkey
doesn't like that plan.

76
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,680
So he actually takes the wheel and he says
actually let's read the entire Wikipedia

77
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,880
page of the Nancy Kerrigan
Tonya Harding scandal.

78
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,480
I just remember that that happened.

79
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,920
Then.

80
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,800
Then we're going to go over to the fridge

81
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,360
to see if it's anything
new in there since ten

82
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,800
minutes ago.

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,480
After that.

84
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,400
We're going to go on a YouTube spiral
that starts with videos of Richard Fineman

85
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,040
talking about magnets
and ends much much later.

86
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,800
With us watching interviews
with Justin Bieber's mom.

87
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,560
Oh that's going to take a while so we're

88
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,240
not going to really have room
on the schedule for any work today sorry.

89
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,440
Now what is going on here

90
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,360
the Instant Gratification Monkey does not
seem like a guy you want behind the wheel.

91
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,240
He lives entirely in the present moment.

92
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,280
He has no memory of the past.

93
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,240
No knowledge of the future and only
cares about two things easy and fun.

94
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,960
Now in the animal world
that works fine if you're a dog and you

95
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,680
spend your whole life doing nothing
other than easy and fun things.

96
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,320
You were a huge success.
And.

97
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,320
To the monkey.

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,040
Humans are just another animal species

99
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,520
to keep well slept well fed
and propagating into the next generation.

100
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,800
Which in tribal times
might have worked OK.

101
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,560
But if you haven't noticed now we're not

102
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,720
in tribal times we're
in an advanced civilization.

103
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,880
And the monkey does not know what that is.

104
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,560
Which is why we have another guy in our
brain the rational decision maker

105
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,680
who gives us the ability to do
things no other animal can do.

106
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,680
We can visualize the future.

107
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,280
We can see the big picture.

108
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,000
We can make long term plans and he
wants to take all of that into account

109
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,680
and he wants to just have us do whatever
makes sense to be doing right now.

110
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,760
Now sometimes it makes sense to be doing
things that are easy and fun like when

111
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,200
you're having dinner or going to bed
or enjoying well earned leisure time.

112
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,720
That's why there's an overlap.

113
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,440
Sometimes they agree.

114
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,320
But other times it makes much more sense

115
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,960
to be doing things that are harder
and less pleasant for the sake of the big

116
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,960
picture and that's when
we have a conflict.

117
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,760
And for the procrastinator that conflict
tends to end the certain way every time

118
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:37,080
leaving him spending a lot of time
in this orange zone and easy and fun

119
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,920
place that's entirely out
of the Make Sense circle.

120
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,760
I call it the dark playground.

121
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,480
Now.

122
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,920
The dark playground is a place that all

123
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,640
of you procrastinators
out there know very well.

124
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,640
It's where leisure activities happen

125
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,320
at times when leisure activities
are not supposed to be happening.

126
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,960
The fun you have in the dark playground

127
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,680
isn't actually fun because it's completely
unearned and the air is filled with guilt

128
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,600
dread anxiety self-hatred all those
good procrastinator feelings.

129
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,320
And the question is in this situation
with the monkey behind the wheel how does

130
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,640
the procrastinator ever get himself over
here to this Blue Zone a less pleasant

131
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,000
place but were really
important things happen.

132
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,120
Well.
It turns out that the procrastinator has

133
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,320
a guardian angel someone who's always
looking down on him and watching over him

134
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,880
in his darkest moments someone
called the panic monster.

135
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,600
Now.

136
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,080
The panic monster is dormant most
of the time but he suddenly wakes up.

137
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,120
Anytime a deadline gets too close or
there's danger of public embarrassment

138
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,800
a career disaster or some
other scary consequence.

139
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,920
And importantly he's the only thing
that the monkey is terrified of.

140
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,800
Now.

141
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,560
He became very relevant in my life pretty
recently because people have Ted reached

142
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,560
out to me about six months ago
and invited me to do a TED talk.

143
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,600
Now of course I said yes it's always been

144
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,760
a dream of mine to have done
a TED talk in the past.

145
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,040
But in the middle of all of this

146
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,920
excitement the rational decision makers
seem to have something else on his mind.

147
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,800
He was saying.
We're not clear on what we just accepted

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,120
do we get what's going to be now happening
one day in the future we need to sit down

149
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,600
and work on this right
now and the monkey said.

150
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,480
Totally agree but also let's just open
Google Earth and let's zoom

151
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,720
in to the bottom of India like
200 feet above the ground.

152
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,080
We're going to scroll up to two and a half

153
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,520
hours to get to the top of the country
so we can get a better feel for India.

154
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,920
So that's what we did that day.

155
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,760
As six months turned into four and then
two and then one the people of Ted decided

156
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,160
to release the speakers
and I opened up the website.

157
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,600
And there was my face
staring right back at me.

158
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,360
And guess who woke up.

159
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,280
So the panic Monster starts losing his

160
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,560
mind and a few seconds later
the whole systems and mayhem.

161
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,280
And the monkey you remember he's terrified

162
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,520
of the panic mounts or
boom he's up the tree.

163
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,600
And finally finally the rational decision

164
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,120
maker can take the wheel and I
can start working on the talk.

165
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:43,240
Now the panic monster explains all kinds
of pretty insane procrastinated behavior

166
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,160
like how someone like me could spend two
weeks unable to start the opening sentence

167
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,720
of a paper and then miraculously
find the unbelievable worth.

168
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,280
Work ethic stay up all
night and write eight pages

169
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,560
and this entire situation
with the three characters.

170
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,880
This is the procrastinators system.
It's not pretty.

171
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,440
But in the end it works.

172
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,320
And this is what I decided
to write about on the blog.

173
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,000
Just a couple of years ago now when I did
I was amazed by the response literally

174
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,720
thousands of e-mails came in from all
different kinds of people from all over

175
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,800
the world doing all
different kinds of things.

176
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,360
These are people who were nurses

177
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,760
and bankers and painters and engineers
and lots and lots of Ph.D. students.

178
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,520
And they were all writing
saying the same thing.

179
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,840
I have this problem too.

180
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,400
But what struck me was the contrast

181
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,840
between the light tone of the post
and the heaviness of these e-mails.

182
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,720
These people were writing with intense

183
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,840
frustration about what procrastination
had done to their lives

184
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,560
about what this monkey had done to them.

185
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,720
And I thought about this and I said
well the procrastinator system works.

186
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,840
What's going on.

187
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,640
Why are all these people
in such a dark place.

188
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,880
Well it turns out that there's
two kinds of procrastination.

189
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,080
Everything I've talked about today

190
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,040
the examples I've given they all have
deadlines and there's deadlines.

191
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,600
The effects of procrastination are

192
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,440
contained to the short term because
the panic monster gets involved.

193
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,480
But there's a second kind

194
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,520
of procrastination that happens
in situations when there is no deadline.

195
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,200
So if you want to have a career you want

196
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,760
to be a self starter something
in the arts something entrepreneurial.

197
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,360
There's no deadlines on those things
first because nothing's happening first.

198
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,760
Not until you've gone out and done

199
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,280
the hard work to get some
momentum to get things going.

200
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,760
There's also all kinds of important things
outside of your career that don't involve

201
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,040
any deadlines like seeing your family or
exercising and taking care of your health.

202
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,440
Working on your relationship or getting
out of a relationship that isn't working.

203
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,920
Now if procrastinators only mechanism.

204
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,960
Of doing these hard things is the panic
Monastir that's a problem because in all

205
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,920
of these non deadlines situations
the panic monster doesn't show up.

206
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,160
Nothing to wake up for.

207
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,560
So the effects of procrastination are not
contain they just extend outward forever.

208
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,240
And it's this long term kind

209
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,120
of procrastination
that's much less visible and much less

210
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,640
talked about than the fun of your
short term deadline based kind.

211
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,760
It's usually suffer quietly and privately.

212
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:16,440
And it can be the source of a huge amount
of long term unhappiness and regrets.

213
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,920
And I thought that's why these people are

214
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,720
emailing and that's why
they're in such a bad place.

215
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,880
It's not that they're cramming for some
project it's that long term

216
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,520
procrastination has made them feel like
a spectator at times in their own lives.

217
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,560
You know the frustration was not that they
couldn't achieve their dreams it's

218
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,520
that they weren't even able
to start chasing them.

219
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,720
So.

220
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,760
I read these emails and I had
a little bit of an epiphany

221
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,920
that I don't think non
procrastinators exist.

222
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,840
That's right.
I think all of you are procrastinators.

223
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,920
Now you might not all be
a mess like some of us.

224
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,920
And some of you may have a healthy
relationship with deadlines.

225
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,760
But remember the monkeys sneakiest trick

226
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,240
is when the deadlines aren't there
now to show you one last thing.

227
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,240
I call this a life calendar.

228
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,280
That's one box for every week
of a 90 year life.

229
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,480
It's not that many boxes especially since
we've already used a bunch of those

230
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:24,520
so I think we need to all take
a long hard look at that calendar.

231
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,400
And we need to think about what we're

232
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:32,680
really procrastinating on because everyone
is procrastinating on something in life.

233
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,040
We need to stay aware of the
instant gratification monkey

234
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,600
that's a job for all of us.

235
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,240
And because there's not that many boxes

236
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,400
on there it's a job that should
probably start today.

237
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,480
Well maybe not today but.

238
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,360
You know.

239
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,000
Sometime soon.
Thank you.
